<!-- @ToDo: Inline About Section -->

## Deployment

### As a node.js Project

Clone the repo and follow the build instructions under [Build Setup](#build-setup).
A node.js version of `10.4` or higher is needed. Older versions may work, but are not tested.

## Development

Pushing to master is restricted. Please work in a `feature/` or `bug/` branch and create a pull request. Merging requires the CI passing, an approved review and the branch being up to date.

### Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install # Or yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start
```

### Code Style

This project uses [Prettier](https://prettier.io) to format code. Prettier should be run before creating a pull request. You can run it with the default settings from your editor. For more information, refer to the [official documentation](https://prettier.io).

### Frameworks

#### Next.js

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [Next.js docs](https://nextjs.org/).
